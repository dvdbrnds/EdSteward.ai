## Critical Path Items

The following items are on the critical path for project completion:

1. AWS infrastructure setup - Foundational requirement
2. Core MCP implementation - Central system functionality
3. Self-compliance validation - Essential for system credibility
4. Multi-tenant architecture - Required for LVAIC beta testing
5. External compliance certification - Needed for commercial viability

## Risk Factors and Contingencies

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| AWS service limitations | Medium | Early research and architecture validation |
| Complex regulation handling | High | Phased approach starting with simplest regulations |
| Multi-tenant data isolation | High | Comprehensive testing and security audits |
| Integration with existing frontend | Medium | Thorough API documentation and phased integration |
| External certification delays | High | Early engagement with auditors and preparation |

## Resource Allocation

As a solo developer, resources will be focused on critical path items first, with AI assistance for:

- Code generation
- Test development
- Documentation creation
- Infrastructure as code implementation
