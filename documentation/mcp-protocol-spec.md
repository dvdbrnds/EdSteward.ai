# MCP Protocol Specification

## 1. Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines the communication standards for the Compliance Tracker system. This protocol facilitates the validation of regulatory compliance through a hierarchical validation approach, providing standardized interfaces for both simple and complex regulatory validation.

## 2. Protocol Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between frontend interpretation and backend validation
- **Hierarchical Validation**: Tiered approach to validation based on regulation complexity
- **Version Control**: Built-in mechanisms for tracking regulatory changes
- **Multi-tenancy Support**: Protocol designed to maintain isolation between tenant data
- **Self-compliance**: Protocol supports the system validating its own compliance
- **External Validation Support**: Framework for external compliance certification

## 3. Validation Levels

### 3.1 Level 1: Static Text Validation
- Simple text comparison for stable regulations
- Checksumming for integrity verification
- Pattern matching for semi-structured text
- Designed for regulations that rarely change (e.g., unchanged for years)
- Optimized for bulk processing

### 3.2 Level 2: Context-Aware Validation
- Semantic analysis of regulation text
- Context-sensitive interpretation
- Reference resolution across multiple sections
- Handling of moderate complexity regulations
- Support for occasional regulatory changes

### 3.3 Level 3: Complex Validation
- Full workflow-based validation
- Decision tree processing for complex regulations
- Machine learning augmentation for interpretation
- Human-in-the-loop capabilities for edge cases
- Support for frequently changing regulations
